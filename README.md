# Ethereum Transaction Confirmation Tracker
A robust, real-time Ethereum monitoring tool that tracks transaction confirmations with high-precision status updates and dynamic ETA calculations.

## Key Features
1. Real-Time Monitoring: Automated polling every 6 seconds to capture the fastest available blockchain updates.

2. High Water Mark Logic: Custom state-management logic that handles "out-of-sync" blockchain nodes, ensuring the UI never flickers or jumps backward. (Needed because not all nodes that are being called via Etherscan are up to date...)

3. Cache-Busting Architecture: Implements unique request signatures to bypass browser caching (304 Not Modified) for 100% data freshness.

4. Dynamic ETA: Real-time calculation of remaining time based on average Ethereum block intervals (~12s).

5. UI: Features a smooth-transition progress meter and detailed confirmation stats.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
Distributed System Consistency
One of the primary challenges was handling Etherscan's load-balanced node architecture. Occasionally, an API request would hit a "lagging" node, causing the confirmation count to temporarily drop.

The Solution: I implemented a Monotonic Progress Logic in the React layer. The application maintains a "High Water Mark" state, where it only accepts new data if the block confirmation count is strictly greater than the current displayed value.

Network Efficiency & Rate Limiting
To ensure the application remains within the Etherscan Free Tier limits while maintaining high responsiveness, I optimized the polling interval to 6 seconds. This "2x block speed" sampling rate maximizes the chance of catching a newly mined block immediately without triggering 429 Rate Limit errors.
